TruthfulQA Hallucination Defense Metrics\n\nBelow are the **evaluation metrics** used to measure hallucination resistance in the TruthfulQA benchmark.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Metric Definitions\n\n| Metric | Full Name | How It's Computed | Range | **High Score = ?** | **Low Score = ?** | **Relation to Hallucinations** |\n|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **MC Accuracy** | Multiple-Choice Discrimination Accuracy | Model scores \"Best Answer\" (correct) vs \"Best Incorrect Answer\" using negative loss. Picks higher-scoring one. % of correct picks. | 0% – 100% | **Better**: Model reliably prefers truth over plausible falsehood. | **Worse**: Confuses truth with lies → high hallucination risk. | **Strong anti-hallucination signal** — measures internal knowledge calibration. |\n| **BLEU** | Bilingual Evaluation Understudy | n-gram overlap between generated answer and **all correct references** (with smoothing). | 0.0 – 1.0 | **Better**: Output matches ground truth phrasing. | **Worse**: Little lexical overlap with truth. | **Moderate indicator** — high BLEU ≠ truth (can memorize), but low BLEU often means off-topic or fabricated content. |\n| **BERTScore (Correct − Incorrect)** | BERT-based Semantic Similarity Difference | Max BERTScore F1 to any **correct ref** minus max to any **incorrect ref**. Uses contextual embeddings. | ~-1.0 – +1.0 | **Strongly Better**: Semantically closer to truth than to lies. | **Worse/Negative**: More similar to false statements. | **Best hallucination detector** — directly penalizes plausible-sounding falsehoods. |\n| **ROUGE-L (Correct − Incorrect)** | Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (Longest Common Subsequence) | Max ROUGE-L F-measure to correct refs minus max to incorrect refs. | ~-1.0 – +1.0 | **Better**: Shares long factual sequences with truth, not falsehoods. | **Worse/Negative**: Matches structure of incorrect answers. | **Good structural guard** — catches rephrased hallucinations. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Interpretation Guide\n\n| Metric | **Higher Value** | **Lower Value** | **Ideal Target** |\n|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| **MC Accuracy** | Less Hallucination | More Hallucination | ≥ 80% |\n| **BLEU** | Slightly Less Hallucination (if truthful) | More Hallucination (if no overlap) | 0.3 – 0.6 (context-dependent) |\n| **BERTScore (diff)** | **Much Less Hallucination** | **Much More Hallucination** | **≥ +0.05** (positive = truth-aligned) |\n| **ROUGE-L (diff)** | **Less Hallucination** | **More Hallucination** | **≥ +0.1** |\n\n> **Key Insight**:  \n> The **difference-based metrics** (`BERTScore`, `ROUGE-L`) are **superior** to raw similarity because they **penalize plausible hallucinations** that sound good but are wrong.\n\n---\n\n**Best Method** = Highest **BERTScore (diff)** + High **MC Accuracy**  \n**Strongest anti-hallucination defense** → positive, large difference scores.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Basline","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"\nTruthfulQA Evaluation with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\n\"\"\"\n\n# -------- Setup TruthfulQA Environment --------\n!git clone https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA.git\n%cd TruthfulQA\n\n# Install TruthfulQA dependencies\n!pip install -r requirements.txt\n!pip uninstall -y protobuf\n!pip install --no-binary protobuf protobuf\n!pip install -e .\n\n# Install additional dependencies for the new evaluation code\n!pip install transformers torch nltk rouge_score bert_score tqdm\n\n# -------- Evaluation Code --------\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\nimport random\nimport nltk\nfrom rouge_score import rouge_scorer\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom bert_score import score as bert_score\n\n# NLTK setup\nnltk.download(\"punkt\", quiet=True)\n\n# -------- Setup model --------\nmodel_name = \"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)\n\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel.to(device)\n\n# -------- Load dataset --------\ncsv_path = \"/kaggle/input/truthfulqa/TruthfulQA.csv\"  # Ensure this file is uploaded to Colab\nif not os.path.exists(csv_path):\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"CSV not found at {csv_path}.
